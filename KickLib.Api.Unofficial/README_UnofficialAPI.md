## Installing ⏫

First, [install NuGet](http://docs.nuget.org/docs/start-here/installing-nuget). 
Then, install [KickLib](https://www.nuget.org/packages/KickLib) from the package manager console:

```
PM> Install-Package KickLib
```
Or from the .NET CLI as:
```
dotnet add package KickLib
```

### Using KickLib via Dependency Injection

If you are using Dependency Injection, you can easily add KickLib via extension method 
`.AddUnofficialKickLib()`, that will register all related services with Scoped lifetime.

Additionally, you need to either register your own client or use prepared builders like `.WithPuppeteerClient()`.

```csharp
serviceCollection
  .AddKickLib()
  .WithPuppeteerClient();
```

## Examples 💡

### Using API to get information
```csharp
IUnofficialKickApi kickApi = new KickUnofficialApi();

var userName = "channelUsername";

// Get information about user
var user = await kickApi.Users.GetUserAsync(userName);

// Get information about channel
var channelInfo = await kickApi.Channels.GetChannelInfoAsync(userName);

// Gets detailed information about current livestream
var liveInfo = await kickApi.Livestream.GetLivestreamInfoAsync(userName);

// Get clips
var channelClips = await kickApi.Clips.GetClipsAsync();
```

### Using `Cursor` to page data

Using following example you can retrieve history messages from channel's chat.
```
IUnofficialKickApi kickApi = new KickUnofficialApi();
var channelInfo = await kickApi.Channels.GetChannelInfoAsync("channelUsername");
var channelId = channelInfo.Id;

KickLib.Models.Response.v2.Channels.Messages.MessagesResponse response = null;
do
{
    response = await kickApi.Channels.GetChannelMessagesAsync(90876, response?.Cursor);
    // Process page response
} while (response.Cursor != null);
```

To get real-time messages, use `IKickClient` (example below).

### Using Client to read chat messages

```csharp
IKickClient client = new KickClient();

client.OnMessage += delegate(object sender, ChatMessageEventArgs e)
{
    Console.WriteLine(e.Data.Content);
};

await client.ListenToChatRoomAsync(123456);
await client.ConnectAsync();
```

### Authenticated API calls

Authenticated calls are tricky as there is no official authentication flow for Unofficial/Private API. 
Currently, authenticated API calls can be done only by enabling 2FA and providing
login credentials and 2FA authorization code.

Step 1: Go to Security settings page on your account:
[https://kick.com/dashboard/settings/security](https://kick.com/dashboard/settings/security)
![Auth flow Step One](../auth_setup1.png)

Step 2: Click `Enable 2FA`. If you already have 2FA enabled, you will need to remove it and add it again.

![Auth flow Step Two](../auth_setup2.png)

Step 3: Copy authentication code show on the screen. Usually in following format:
`A123BCDEFGIJFKLM`. You need to save this code! You can't view it again after you finish setup.

Step 4: Finalize 2FA setup using Authentication app of your choice.

Step 5: You're done! Now you can use Authorization code in KickLib to generate correct TOTP tokens.

```csharp
IUnofficialKickApi kickApi = new KickUnofficialApi();
var authSettings = new AuthenticationSettings("username", "password")
{
    TwoFactorAuthCode = "A123BCDEFGIJFKLM"
};
    
await kickApi.AuthenticateAsync(authSettings);
await kickApi.Messages.SendMessageAsync(123456, "My message");
```

## Custom downloader client

If you are not satisfied with provided client, you can implement your own download logic. 
All you need to do is implement `IApiCaller` interface and pass new instance to `KickApi`.

```csharp
public class MyOwnDownloader : IApiCaller 
{
    // Implementation
}
```
```csharp
var myDownloader = new MyOwnDownloader();
IUnofficialKickApi kickApi = new KickUnofficialApi(myDownloader);
```
